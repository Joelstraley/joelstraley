I'm a Full Stack (MERN) Web Developer who graduated from the Columbia Engineering Coding Bootcamp. 

I recently worked in Operations and Logistics. During the COVID-19 pandemic I worked with The Migrant Kitchen to build a dynamic logistic strategy to deliver 1,000 meals a day, six days a week to NYC residents in all 5 burroughs. 

Previously, I worked for several years at Uber as an Operation Specialist. I also do improv and sketch comedy in NYC.
